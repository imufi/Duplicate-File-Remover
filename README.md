Intro:
The DuplicateFileRemover class in the code performs the task of finding and moving duplicate files in specified directories. It computes the MD5 hash of each file to identify duplicates and logs messages using the Logger framework. The file server invokes this utility to remove duplicate files upon user request, scanning directories for duplicates and organizing them into groups for efficient management. Duplicate files are moved to a review directory while maintaining the original directory structure.Concurrency mechanisms and proper error handling are implemented, and thorough testing and validation will be conducted before deployment to guarantee the accuracy and reliability of the duplicate file removal operation.

Code
Imports:
The code imports necessary Java libraries for file handling, security, logging, and collections.

Class Definition:
The DuplicateFileRemover class contains the main method and other utility methods for finding and moving duplicate files.

Logger Initialization:
The code initializes a Logger object for logging messages. It's configured to log messages for this class.

Main Method:
The main method is the entry point of the program. It specifies the source directory path and the review directory path, and then calls the findAndMoveDuplicateFiles method.

findAndMoveDuplicateFiles Method:
This method takes two parameters: sourceDirectoryPath and reviewDirectoryPath.
It traverses through the source directory and computes the MD5 hash of each file using the getMD5Checksum method.
The MD5 hashes and corresponding file paths are stored in a Map<String, List<String>> where the key is the MD5 hash, and the value is a list of file paths with the same hash.
It then iterates through the map to find duplicate files (files with the same MD5 hash).
If duplicate files are found, they are moved to the review directory while logging relevant messages.

getMD5Checksum Method:
This method computes the MD5 checksum of a given file.
It reads the file content in chunks, updates the MessageDigest instance with the content, and finally computes the MD5 hash.
The computed hash is returned as a hexadecimal string.

Logging:
The program logs messages using the java.util.logging.Logger framework.
Errors, warnings, and information messages are logged to provide insight into the program's execution and any encountered issues.

Implementation
Initiating Duplicate File Removal:
Upon receiving a request from a client, the file server invokes the duplicate file removal process.
Clients typically specify the directories they want to scan for duplicate files.

Scanning for Duplicate Files:
The file server utilizes the DuplicateFileRemover utility to scan the specified directories for duplicate files.
The utility computes the MD5 checksum for each file within the directories to uniquely identify them.

Identifying Duplicate Files:
Files with identical MD5 checksums are identified as duplicates.
The utility organizes these files into groups, making it easier to manage them.

Moving Duplicate Files:
Upon identifying duplicate files, the utility moves them to a review directory.
The original directory structure is maintained, ensuring minimal disruption to the file system.

User Feedback and Monitoring:
Throughout the process, the file server provides feedback to users regarding the status of the duplicate file removal operation.
Users are informed about the progress of the scan, the number of duplicate files found, and any encountered errors.

Security and Integrity:
The file server ensures the security and integrity of the file system during the duplicate file removal process.
Proper access controls and permissions are enforced to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive files and directories.

Concurrency and Performance Optimization:
To optimize performance, the file server may implement concurrency mechanisms to handle large file systems efficiently.
Concurrent scanning and processing of directories help expedite the duplicate file removal process.

Logging and Error Handling:
The file server logs important events and errors encountered during the duplicate file removal operation.
Detailed error messages are provided to aid in troubleshooting and resolving issues promptly.

Testing and Validation:
Before deployment, the integration undergoes rigorous testing to ensure the accuracy and reliability of duplicate file detection and removal.
Validation tests verify the correctness of file movement operations and the overall functionality of the integration.
